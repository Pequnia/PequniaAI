# **PequniaAI**

PequniaAI is a personalized AI framework designed to create unique virtual agents with distinct personalities, behaviors, and communication styles. Users can train their AI agents using custom data, define specific traits, and deploy the agents for various purposes like customer support, education, or entertainment.

## **Overview**

PequniaAI allows users to:
- Define unique personalities for agents based on traits like humor, professionalism, or friendliness.
- Train agents using user-provided data and machine learning models.
- Deploy trained agents for real-world applications.

This project leverages modern machine learning libraries like PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers to ensure a robust and scalable AI solution.

## **Features**

- **Personalized AI Agents**: Define behaviors, personalities, and specific traits for each agent.
- **Neural Network Training**: Train agents using machine learning models.
- **Command-line Integration**: Run key operations (training, prediction, etc.) with simple terminal commands.
- **Scalable and Extendable**: Add new plugins, traits, or behaviors with ease.
- **Predefined Commands**: Automate tasks like training, predicting, and cleaning up with `Makefile`.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Pip**: Ensure you have the latest version of `pip` installed.
- **Git**: Optional but recommended for managing project versions.

### **Step-by-step Installation**
1. Clone the PequniaAI repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PequniaAI.git
   cd PequniaAI
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
3. Verify installation by running a quick test:
   ```bash
   python predict_behavior.py "I like to tell jokes but remain professional."
   ```

## **Quick Start Guide**

### **Training the Model**
1. Open the `PequniaAI.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells to preprocess data, train the model, and save it.

Alternatively, use the `Makefile` to execute the training:
```bash
make run_train
```

### **Making Predictions**
After training the model, use the `run_predict` command to make predictions based on an input text:
```bash
make run_predict
```

Example output:
```
Predicted Behavior: humorous
```

### **Cleaning Temporary Files**
Clean up unnecessary files and cache using:
```bash
make clean
```

| Command               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make install`        | Installs required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.               |
| `make run_train`      | Runs the training pipeline.                                                 |
| `make run_predict`    | Predicts the behavior of a given input text using the trained model.       |
| `make clean`          | Removes temporary files and cached data.                                   |

## **How to Add Plugins**

### **What are Plugins?**
Plugins allow you to extend PequniaAI’s capabilities, such as adding custom traits, integrating new machine learning models, or modifying agent behaviors.

### **Adding a New Trait**
1. Add a new entry in `data.csv` under the `Specific Traits` column:
   ```csv
   Name,Age,Gender,Behavior,Specific Traits
   Alex,27,Non-binary,humorous,"likes to incorporate sci-fi references in jokes"
   ```
2. Re-run the training pipeline to update the model.

### **Custom Neural Networks**
1. Create a new Python file (e.g., `custom_model.py`) and define your architecture:
   ```python
   import torch.nn as nn

   class CustomNN(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
           super(CustomNN, self).__init__()
           self.fc = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)
       
       def forward(self, x):
           return self.fc(x)
   ```
2. Update the main training script to use your custom model.

## **Further Development**

### **Potential Use Cases**
- **Customer Support**: Deploy agents tailored to handle specific types of queries.
- **Education**: Create AI tutors with distinct teaching styles.
- **Entertainment**: Develop interactive AI characters for games or storytelling.

### **Integrating with Web Platforms**
PequniaAI can be integrated with web applications using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI. Here’s how to get started:
1. Create a Flask or FastAPI API to handle requests.
2. Use the trained model to generate responses in real-time.
